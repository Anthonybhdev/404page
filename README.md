Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Hello my demo can be found on github as 404 page.
- My experience was good as I learn how to use Bootstrap to build columns and rows to make site responsive & user friendly.
- I have learned how to layout a website in a dynamic & responsive way.
- The more I learn about web development the more I understand the ability to look for answers and not feel like I should know all the solutions to my problems.

### Built With



- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


## Features



This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://www.figma.com/file/QeKWLNhB13zDjJzqR22TKE/404-page-challenge?node-id=1%3A4&t=GV71mMjjqiDts6lN-0) was to build an application that is a basic 404 No page found screen.
